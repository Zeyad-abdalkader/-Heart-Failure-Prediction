# Heart-Failure-Prediction
This project is a machine learning application for predicting heart failure based on patients' clinical data. Using a dataset of 12 medical features, the system applies various classification algorithms to assess the risk of death due to heart failure.

# Results
After training and evaluating multiple machine learning models on the heart failure dataset:<br>
Best Performing Model: **Random Forest**.<br>
Achieved **85% accuracy**, making it the most reliable model for predicting heart failure in this dataset.<br>
**SVM** and **XGBoost** also performed well with **83% accuracy**.
